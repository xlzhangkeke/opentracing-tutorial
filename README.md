# OpenTracing Tutorial - Go

## Installing

The tutorials are using CNCF Jaeger (https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) as the tracing backend, 
[see here](../README.md) how to install it in a Docker image.

This repository uses Go's new [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep) tool to manage dependencies (installed automatically below).

When you clone the tutorials repository, it should be located in the right place under `$GOPATH`:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/yurishkuro/
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yurishkuro/
git clone https://github.com/yurishkuro/opentracing-tutorial.git opentracing-tutorial
```

After that, install the dependencies:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yurishkuro/opentracing-tutorial/go
make install
```

The rest of the commands in the Go tutorials should be executed relative to this directory.
